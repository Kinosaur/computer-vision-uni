# Computer Vision University - Free Educational Resources

This repository contains hands-on code and notebooks for learning computer vision using Python and OpenCV. It is designed for students, educators, and self-learners who want practical examples and ready-to-run experiments.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **Python Scripts & Notebooks**: Step-by-step lessons and demos (e.g., edge detection, Hough transforms, image blending, super-resolution).
- **superResModels/**: Pretrained models for super-resolution (EDSR, ESPCN, FSRCNN, LapSRN) used with OpenCV's dnn_superres module.
- **pictures/** & **tattoo/**: Sample images for experiments and demonstrations.
- **results/**: Output images generated by scripts and notebooks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/computer-vision-uni.git
   cd computer-vision-uni
   ```
2. **Set up Python environment**
   - Recommended: Python 3.8+
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
3. **Run Notebooks & Scripts**
   - Open Jupyter Notebook and run `.ipynb` files for interactive demos.
   - Run `.py` scripts for standalone experiments.

## 🧑‍💻 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (with contrib modules)
- matplotlib

## 📚 Educational Topics Covered

- Image reading, displaying, and cropping
- Edge detection (Canny)
- Hough line and circle transforms
- Image blending and pyramids
- Super-resolution with pretrained models

## 📝 How to Use

- Each notebook/script is self-contained and includes comments for learning.
- Sample images are provided for immediate experimentation.
- Output images are saved in the `results/` folder.
